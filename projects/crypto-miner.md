summary: "A simple cryptocurrency miner I set up using a raspberry pi and the raspbian 64 bit OS"
---

Although I think I am a bit late to the cryptocurrency craze, I wanted to practice using the command line and set up a raspberry pi to mine the cryptocurrency monero. Although a raspberry pi is not a powerful machine, I was able to generate a hashrate of 108 hashes a second through mining in a shared pool. Though it is definitely not mining at a fast enough rate to make some actual money, it was still a fun project and I learned a lot about the blockchain and why cryptocurrency is so cool. Through the open source software XMRig, I was able to clone the repository, and contribute the computing power of my raspberry pi to my selected shared pool.

I chose to mine monero because compared to a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, monero is more decentralized and it would be easier for me to earn a more fair share of XMR for my hashing contribution. If I chose to mine a more popular cryptocurrency like bitcoin, or etherium, I would need to compete against people who have warehouses full of computers mining. The chance that I would add a block to the blockchain would be the same as winning the lottery.

Although I currently do not have this raspberry pi still running, I learned a lot through this project and hope to repurpose this raspberry pi by creating a kubernetes cluster of multiple raspberry pi's.
