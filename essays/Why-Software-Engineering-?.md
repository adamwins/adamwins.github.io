## Certainty in Uncertainty:

At some point in our lives, we have all been uncertain about something. Whether it be about what major to pursue, what job to apply for, or even something as simple as - what should I eat today? Weâ€™ve all been there. For me, I am uncertain about my future in software engineering. I do not have any specific goals for where I would like to work after I graduate. However, since I also have a passion for cybersecurity, I would love to work in a career that combines both cybersecurity and software engineering.

##  One Step at a Time:

Day by day, I am constantly learning and trying to improve my skills related to software engineering. Whether it be practicing programming, studying algorithms, or working on personal projects, I try to do a little each day to improve. Programming is not easy, so I like to think of it as a journey. Taking one step at a time, by the time I graduate, I hope to have gained the skills necessary to secure a good job after graduation. I am also actively seeking out internships so that I have the opportunity to put into practice the skills I am taught in class and apply them in a professional setting.

## Coding Dopamine:

Although I am uncertain about the path software engineering will lead me down, I know for a fact that it will be rewarding. I believe that finally finding that semicolon I forgot, and finally getting my program to run the way I want is one of the best feelings ever. I love the fact that when you program, anything is possible and there is so much flexibility in the way you can achieve a desired result. While I may not consider myself a creative person, programming often enables me to think outside the box and approach problems from a unique perspective. Software engineering is not easy, but it is the moment of finally getting your code to compile the way you want it to that makes it worth the effort.
