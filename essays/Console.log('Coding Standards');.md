## Why are Standards Even Important?

You may be asking yourself, “Why is the paper's title the way it is?” Well, it is because it demonstrates the coding standards we follow for JavaScript. Although coding standards are usually trivial details that have no impact on the outcome of the code, they serve a significant role in helping you learn the language you are programming in. It may not seem like much, but implementing these coding standards into your code helps with readability, clarity, and helps you discover errors in your code quicker.
## Consistency is Key

Now, as I mentioned earlier, coding standards are typically understood as trivial details that you design your code to follow. One example of this would be adding a semicolon to the end of each of your JavaScript statements despite it not being necessary for the code to compile. While you may think something like that is trivial, following these types of coding standards consistently will result in more readable code. Not only is this a good thing if others want to take a look at your code, but it also means it is easier to identify potential bugs in your code. These things are extremely useful when learning a programming language because consistently practicing these standards will allow you to spend less effort formatting code and more time on things like the logic of your code.


## Love the Green Checkmark

I’ll be completely honest; at first, I hated ESlint and I thought it was dumb. I thought it didn’t make any sense to use ESlint when the IntelliJ IDE already points out errors. After some thought, though, I actually find ESlint to be very useful, especially for the reasons I pointed out earlier. I realize that when we program, we should be programming for long-term improvement. Following these code formats will help us in the long term, even if it may be annoying in the beginning. Eventually, we will not even need to think about how we format our code, and it will become a habit. Building these good habits contributes to becoming a better programmer, and that is what our goal should be.
## Love the Red Checkmark

At the end of the day, coding standards exist for a reason, and that is for us to improve. Not only do coding standards help with other people being able to read your code, more easily spot errors, and focus on the fundamentals of programming, but it also helps with personal growth as a programmer. As annoying as errors may be, they offer the opportunity to grow and get better. The same applies to ESlint; even though these errors will not affect the overall outcome of the code, fixing these coding standard errors will aid in your growth.
