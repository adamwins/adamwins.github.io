## What Even is a Smart Question?

I am sure you are probably wondering the same thing because that is the first question that came to my mind when writing this essay. Well, a smart question, in regards to software engineering, is a question that requires you to put in some extra effort before asking anyone else. Typically, this extra effort requires you to consult other sources first and do prior research about things related to your question. On a site like StackOverflow, which is meant for technical questions, asking a “dumb” question results in your question being overlooked and not taken seriously.

## Every Question is a Good Question… Not

I am also sure that you have heard the phrase, “Every question is a good question,” or something along those lines throughout your time in school. Despite this very optimistic view on asking questions, when it comes to programming, that is not the case. In my opinion, the most important soft skill a programmer can have is being resourceful. As a software engineer, you will never know the answer to everything, and at some point, you will get stuck. It is at this point that finding the answer to your question takes resourcefulness, and asking smart questions will help guide you to the solution you are searching for.

## Smart Questions lead to solutions

Now that we all know what a smart question is, let us both look at one example that demonstrates why asking smart questions is so important. For example, the question, “How would you explain JavaScript closures to someone with a knowledge of the concepts they consist of (for example functions, variables, and the like), but does not understand closures themselves?” This is a smart question because it is open-ended and is more specific than compared to, “How do closures work in JavaScript,” to which one might expect the answer, “STFW.” In the replies, people were helpful and even created an analogy specific to the question asked. Overall, the comments were very receptive to the question.

## Dumb Questions Lead to Dumb Comments

Now, let us take a look at an example of a dumb question. One question that does not fulfill the smart question guidelines is, “Is there a Java web compiler that doesn't require an account and also has an interactive console?” This is an example of a dumb question because this is a question that could be answered with a simple web search. The one reply to this question was just links to websites that the person asking easily could have found themselves. This is one example of a question that would usually get the response, “STFW.”

Overall, as an aspiring software engineer, the ability to ask the right questions and in the right way is a skill that is very important. As we could see from the examples, there is a difference in the quality of the questions, and if you need help with something, you need to make sure you put in the effort on your part as well before asking.
