##JavaScript Gymnastics:

In my experience with JavaScript, the syntax and flexibility are much friendlier for beginners like myself. Although I have prior experience with coding, I think I could do a lot to improve, and I am constantly looking to enhance my coding ability. I appreciate how simple the JavaScript syntax is, especially compared to a language like Java. This flexibility is also what makes JavaScript such a good language for software engineering. JavaScript also has many different frameworks like Node, React, Meteor, and many more. These frameworks help with full-stack development and contribute to why JavaScript is such a popular language among software developers.


## Battle of the Javas:

Throughout my time in college, all of my programming classes have been focused on the Java language. When comparing JavaScript to Java, JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens, allowing functions to be parameters for other functions themselves. The fact that functions in JavaScript can be treated as any other object allows for less repetitive code when compared to a language like Java, which does not have that kind of flexibility. Not only does JavaScript offer more flexibility in its code, but it also allows you to code directly into your browser, which means you do not need a compiler. When coding in Java, you need a compiler to run your code, so it is not as convenient.

## Programming, it's a marathon, not a race:
One thing we have all learned from Aesop’s “The Tortoise and the Hare” is that slow and steady wins the race. I think this idea can be applied to many things, programming being one of them. Through consistent programming, you will eventually be ready for something like a hackathon. If we compare programming to running a marathon, marathons take months, maybe even years, to prepare for. The same can be said about programming, and if it works for marathons, why wouldn’t it work for programming? I believe in the approach that if every day you improve, even if just a little, given some time you will be significantly better than when you first started. So let’s all set our eyes on the hackathon and start prepping now for the marathon we know we will run.
